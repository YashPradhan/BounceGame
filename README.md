A personal project to explore HTML/CSS/Javascript. This game is still in the works and involves a ball bouncing around the player's screen. The player has control of a paddle at the bottom and attempts to bounce the ball to keep it in the playing area for as long as possible.
To launch the game, download the contents of this repo to your local device. Then, open up your browser and open the HTML file. Enjoy!
